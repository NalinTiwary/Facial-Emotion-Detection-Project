# Facial-Emotion-Detection-Project
This was  a Project I completed in my Summer Vacations to get a better understanding on Neural Networks.This repository contains code which uses to Deep Learning to train a model to predict the emotion a person is showing from his/her Facial Expressions. The model can predict whether the person is Sad, Happy, Angry, Suprised or Neutral. I have trained both a Multi-Layer Perceptron and a Convolutional Neural Network to make the prediction. I hava also used Transfferd Learning to make a prediction using the VGG model.
